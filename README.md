## Location Service with Permissions (location_service_with_permission)

**Effortlessly manage location services and permissions in your Flutter apps.**

This package simplifies location tracking by automating permission requests and providing convenient methods for accessing location updates, including background mode support on Android and iOS.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:**

```yaml
dependencies:
  location_service_with_permission: ^version_number
```

## Android

**Using Location Background Mode and Permissions**

Using Location Background Mode and Permissions

To use location background mode on Android, you need to enable it using the LocationService.enableBackgroundMode(true) API before accessing location in the background. The package will request the necessary permissions (android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE and android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) during initialization.
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION"/>
```

## iOS

**Using Location Background Mode and Permissions**

Using Location Background Mode and Permissions

To receive location updates when the app is in the background on iOS, add the following key-value pair to your Info.plist file:

UIBackgroundModes = [
  location
]

The package will request the appropriate permission (either NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription or NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription) based on your usage scenario.
```plist
// This is probably the only one you need. Background location is supported
// by this -- the caveat is that a blue badge is shown in the status bar
// when the app is using location service while in the background.
NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription

// Deprecated, use NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription instead.
NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription

// Use this very carefully. This key is required only if your iOS app
// uses APIs that access the userâ€™s location information at all times,
// even if the app isn't running.
NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
```
