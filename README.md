## Flutter Location Service: Simplified Location Management

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for managing location in your Flutter applications. It streamlines the process of:

* **Requesting Location Permissions:** Handles user permission requests with persistent asking (optional app settings redirection).
* **Checking Location Service Status:** Ensures the device's location service is enabled before proceeding.
* **Getting Real-Time Location Updates:** Provides a stream to continuously receive location updates.
* **Fetching Single Location Data:** Retrieves the device's current location as a one-time operation.

**Key Features:**

* **Effortless Integration:** Simplifies location access with a unified API.
* **User-Friendly Permission Flow:** Guides users through permission requests gracefully.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Catches and reports location service and permission issues.
* **Well-Documented:** Provides clear documentation and code examples.

### Installation

**Changes made:**
